                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>
                  Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or
                  phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of
                  biology. A botanist, plant scientist or phytologist is a
                  scientist who specialises in this field. The term "botany"
                  comes from the Ancient Greek word βοτάνη (botanē) meaning
                  "pasture", "grass", or "fodder"; βοτάνη is in turn derived
                  from βόσκειν (boskein), "to feed" or "to graze".
                  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and
                  algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the
                  study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the
                  sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately
                  410,000 species of land plants of which some 391,000 species
                  are vascular plants (including approximately 369,000 species
                  of flowering plants),[4] and approximately 20,000 are
                  bryophytes.

                <h4>Early botany</h4>
                <p>
                  There is evidence humans used plants as far back as 10,000
                  years ago in the Little Tennessee River Valley, generally as
                  firewood or food. Botany originated as herbalism, the study
                  and use of plants for their medicinal properties. The early
                  recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and
                  plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have
                  been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before
                  1100 BC Ancient Egypt in archaic Avestan writings, and in
                  works from China purportedly from before 221 BC.

                <h4>Late modern botany</h4>
                <p>
                  Building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that
                  originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann
                  (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through
                  gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters.The
                  work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy is still a
                  major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and
                  Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology
                  texts for more than half a century.

                <h4>Scope and importance</h4>
                <p>
                  The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all
                  animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the
                  oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with
                  aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to
                  exist.

                <h4>Human nutrition</h4>
                <p>
                  Virtually all staple foods come either directly from primary
                  production by plants, or indirectly from animals that eat
                  them.Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base
                  of most food chains because they use the energy from the sun
                  and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them
                  into a form that can be used by animals.

                <h4>Plant biochemistry</h4>
                <p>
                  Plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used
                  by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary
                  metabolism like the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and
                  crassulacean acid metabolism.[77] Others make specialised
                  materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their
                  bodies, and secondary products like resins and aroma
                  compounds.
